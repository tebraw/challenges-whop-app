// Company Owner Detection Strategy Fix

The current issue is that when a company owner downloads and accesses their app via Whop:

1. They access via Whop iframe/embed context
2. Whop passes headers with user ID and company ID
3. They navigate to /admin or admin routes
4. Our app should recognize them as the company owner

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- API calls to Whop's company ownership endpoint might be failing
- Headers might not be in expected format
- User gets created as 'USER' instead of 'ADMIN'

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Enhanced header detection for multiple format variations
2. Added context-based company owner detection (admin access patterns)
3. Added fallback logic when API calls fail
4. Better error logging to debug API issues

NEXT STEPS:
1. Verify if deployment is working
2. Test with actual Whop access
3. Check server logs for specific API errors
4. Implement emergency admin promotion if needed

The key insight: If someone is accessing /admin routes via Whop with proper company context,
they should be treated as company owner regardless of API call results.
