# Challenge Creation Fix Deployment

## Issue
Challenge creation from Whop Business Dashboard was failing with "Context required" error.

## Fix Applied
- Updated `/api/challenges` route to properly handle company owner mode
- Added fallback logic: `experienceId: experienceId || tenantId`
- Fixed auto-user creation to support both experience and company contexts

## Deployment Status
- Fix committed: `6d31a63`
- Deployment triggered: September 13, 2025
- Production URL: `9nmw5yleoqldrxf7n48c.apps.whop.com`

## Expected Result
Challenge creation should now work successfully from:
- Whop Business Dashboard (company owner mode)
- Experience iframe (experience member mode)

## Testing
After deployment, test challenge creation from:
`https://whop.com/dashboard/biz_YoIIIT73rXwrtK/apps/app_ZYUHlzHinpA5Ce/`
