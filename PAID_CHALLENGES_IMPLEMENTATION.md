# Paid Challenges Implementation - Complete Guide

## üéØ Overview

Implemented a complete paid challenges system with inline payment widgets and webhook-based enrollment validation. This replaces the broken full-page redirect flow with a proper UX that stays within the Whop iFrame.

## üìä Problem Analysis

### Issues Found in Original Implementation:

1. **UX Problem**: Full-page redirect (`window.location.href`) exits iFrame context
2. **Security Issue**: Fake `checkPaymentStatus` always returned 'completed' without verification
3. **Revenue Issue**: All payments go to app owner, no distribution to challenge creators
4. **Enrollment Issue**: Users enrolled without actual payment verification

## ‚úÖ Solution Architecture (3 Phases)

### Phase 1: Inline Payment Widget ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Replace full-page redirect with inline modal using Whop iFrame SDK

**Changes Made**:

1. **JoinChallengeButton.tsx**
   - Added `useIframeSdk()` hook
   - Replaced redirect with `iframeSdk.inAppPurchase(inAppPurchase)`
   - Added enrollment status polling after payment
   - Removed localStorage session tracking

2. **lib/whop-payments.ts**
   - Updated `initiatePayment()` to return `inAppPurchase` object
   - Removed checkout URL generation
   - Added `inAppPurchase?: any` to `PaymentInitResponse` interface

3. **app/api/challenges/[challengeId]/join/route.ts**
   - Returns `inAppPurchase` object instead of `checkoutUrl`
   - Updated validation logic

4. **app/api/challenges/[challengeId]/enrollment-status/route.ts** (NEW)
   - Polling endpoint for enrollment confirmation
   - Uses Whop authentication
   - Returns `{ enrolled: boolean, enrollmentId?: string }`

**Flow**:
```
User clicks "Join" 
  ‚Üí API creates charge via chargeUser
  ‚Üí Returns inAppPurchase object
  ‚Üí Client calls iframeSdk.inAppPurchase(inAppPurchase)
  ‚Üí Inline modal opens (stays on page!)
  ‚Üí User completes payment
  ‚Üí Modal closes
  ‚Üí Client polls /enrollment-status
  ‚Üí Webhook creates enrollment (Phase 2)
  ‚Üí Polling succeeds
  ‚Üí User redirected to challenge view
```

### Phase 2: Webhook-Based Enrollment ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Create enrollments only when payment is actually confirmed via webhook

**Changes Made**:

1. **app/api/webhooks/route.ts**
   - Implemented `handlePaymentSuccess()` function
   - Extracts metadata (challengeId, experienceId, creatorId)
   - Finds user by whopUserId
   - Creates enrollment in database
   - Creates RevenueShare record with 90/10 split
   - Prevents duplicate enrollments

2. **Deprecated/Removed**:
   - ‚ùå `app/api/challenges/[challengeId]/check-payment/route.ts` (deleted)
   - ‚ùå `checkPaymentStatus()` in whop-payments.ts (deprecated)
   - ‚ùå localStorage payment session logic

**Webhook Flow**:
```
Whop payment succeeds
  ‚Üí payment.succeeded webhook fires
  ‚Üí Validates webhook signature
  ‚Üí Extracts payment data + metadata
  ‚Üí Finds user in database
  ‚Üí Creates enrollment
  ‚Üí Creates RevenueShare record (90% creator, 10% platform)
  ‚Üí Returns 200 OK to Whop
  ‚Üí Client polling detects enrollment
  ‚Üí User gets access
```

**Revenue Share Calculation**:
- Input: `amount_after_fees` (Whop's amount after card fees)
- Creator gets: 90% of `amount_after_fees`
- Platform gets: 10% of `amount_after_fees`
- Status: `pending` (actual payout in Phase 3)

### Phase 3: Revenue Distribution ‚è≥ PENDING

**Goal**: Automatically distribute revenue to challenge creators via Whop payUser API

**What Needs to Be Done**:

1. **Get Company Ledger Account ID**
   ```typescript
   const ledger = await whopSdk.companies.getCompanyLedgerAccount({ 
     companyId: process.env.WHOP_COMPANY_ID 
   });
   const ledgerAccountId = ledger.id;
   // Add to .env: WHOP_LEDGER_ACCOUNT_ID=...
   ```

2. **Update lib/revenue-sharing.ts**
   - Remove mock implementation
   - Add real payUser API call:
   ```typescript
   const transfer = await whopSdk.payments.payUser({
     amount: creatorAmountCents / 100, // Convert back to dollars
     destinationId: whopCreatorId,
     ledgerAccountId: process.env.WHOP_LEDGER_ACCOUNT_ID,
     metadata: {
       type: 'challenge_revenue_share',
       challengeId,
       revenueShareId
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Update RevenueShare record**
   - Set `transferId` from payUser response
   - Set `status` to 'completed'
   - Set `processedAt` to current timestamp
   - Handle failures with retry logic

4. **Trigger from Webhook**
   - Call revenue distribution after creating RevenueShare record
   - Or use background job queue for reliability

**Costs** (from Whop docs):
- Next-day ACH payout: $2.50 per payout
- Instant payout: 4% + $1.00 per payout
- Whop platform fee: 0% (3% only for Discord/Telegram integrations)

**Implementation Note**: 
We decided on manual revenue distribution via `payUser` API because Whop Products do NOT support automatic revenue splitting (Option C doesn't exist as originally requested).

## üîß Technical Details

### Metadata Structure

Payment metadata stored with each charge:

```typescript
{
  type: 'challenge_entry',
  challengeId: string,
  experienceId: string,
  creatorId: string,          // Internal user ID
  whopCreatorId: string,      // Whop user ID for payouts
  totalAmount: string,        // Total in cents
  creatorAmount: string,      // 90% in cents
  platformAmount: string,     // 10% in cents
  appEntity: 'challenge_enrollment'
}
```

### Database Schema

**RevenueShare Model**:
```prisma
model RevenueShare {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  challengeId   String
  creatorId     String
  whopCreatorId String
  paymentId     String    // Whop payment ID
  amount        Int       // Creator amount in cents
  platformFee   Int       // Platform fee in cents
  transferId    String?   // Whop transfer ID from payUser
  status        String    @default("pending")
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  processedAt   DateTime?
  errorMessage  String?
  retryCount    Int       @default(0)
  
  challenge     Challenge @relation(...)
  creator       User      @relation(...)
}
```

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `/api/challenges/[id]/join` | POST | Create charge, return inAppPurchase | ‚úÖ Updated |
| `/api/challenges/[id]/enrollment-status` | GET | Poll for enrollment after payment | ‚úÖ New |
| `/api/webhooks` | POST | Handle payment.succeeded events | ‚úÖ Updated |
| `/api/challenges/[id]/check-payment` | POST | Old verification endpoint | ‚ùå Deleted |

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Phase 1 & 2 Testing (Current):

- [ ] Click "Join Challenge" on paid challenge
- [ ] Verify inline modal opens (doesn't leave page)
- [ ] Complete test payment
- [ ] Verify modal closes
- [ ] Verify enrollment is created via webhook
- [ ] Verify user gets redirected to challenge view
- [ ] Verify user can access challenge content
- [ ] Test payment cancellation (should NOT create enrollment)

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Needed:

```bash
# Already configured:
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # For webhook validation

# Needed for Phase 3:
WHOP_COMPANY_ID=biz_...       # Your Whop company ID
WHOP_LEDGER_ACCOUNT_ID=...    # From getCompanyLedgerAccount
```

### Webhook Configuration:

1. Go to Whop Dashboard ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Ensure webhook URL is configured: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks`
3. Ensure `payment.succeeded` event is enabled
4. Webhook secret should match `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in env

### Testing in Development:

Use Whop's test mode for payments:
1. Enable test mode in Whop dashboard
2. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Any future date for expiry
4. Any CVC

## üìà Success Metrics

### Before (Broken):
- ‚ùå Full-page redirects break iFrame UX
- ‚ùå Users enrolled without payment verification
- ‚ùå All revenue goes to app owner
- ‚ùå No revenue distribution to creators
- ‚ùå Fake payment validation

### After (Phase 1 & 2):
- ‚úÖ Inline payment modal (stays in iFrame)
- ‚úÖ Webhook-based enrollment verification
- ‚úÖ Revenue split tracking (90/10)
- ‚úÖ Proper payment validation
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenancy compliant

### Future (Phase 3):
- ‚è≥ Automatic revenue distribution
- ‚è≥ Creator payouts within 24 hours
- ‚è≥ Retry logic for failed payouts
- ‚è≥ Complete revenue tracking

## üéì Key Learnings

1. **Whop Products DON'T support automatic revenue splitting** - Must use manual `payUser` API
2. **iFrame SDK is already installed** - Available via `useIframeSdk()` hook
3. **Metadata is crucial** - Store all context needed for webhook processing
4. **amount_after_fees !== final_amount** - Use `amount_after_fees` for revenue calculation
5. **Webhooks must return 200 quickly** - Use `waitUntil()` for long operations
6. **Prevention > Cure** - Check for existing enrollment before creating
