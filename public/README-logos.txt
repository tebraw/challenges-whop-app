Place your logo image at public/neu.png.

Notes:
- The headers now reference /neu.png with a client-side fallback to /logo-growth.png.
- If you can't see the logo, ensure neu.png exists under public/ and matches the expected filename and extension.
- Optional: keep logo-growth.png as a fallback image during the transition.
