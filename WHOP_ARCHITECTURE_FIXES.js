// FIXED WHOP APP ARCHITECTURE PLAN
// =================================

/**
 * PROBLEM ANALYSIS (What we did wrong):
 * 
 * ❌ WRONG: Company-based Multi-Tenancy
 *    - We created tenants per whopCompanyId
 *    - Problem: One company can have multiple communities/experiences
 *    - Result: Data bleeding between different app installations
 * 
 * ✅ CORRECT: Experience-based Isolation
 *    - Each Experience (app installation in community) = separate instance
 *    - experienceId is the isolation boundary
 *    - Same company, different communities = separate data
 */

/**
 * WHAT EACH TERM MEANS:
 * 
 * Company: A Whop business (like "Fitness Hub LLC")
 * Experience: An app installation in a specific community
 * Community: A group/server where the app is installed
 * 
 * Example:
 * - Company "Fitness Hub LLC" has 3 communities:
 *   1. "Beginner Fitness" community → Experience A
 *   2. "Advanced Fitness" community → Experience B  
 *   3. "Nutrition Tips" community → Experience C
 * 
 * - Each Experience should have separate challenges!
 * - Company owner is admin in ALL their experiences
 */

/**
 * ARCHITECTURAL FIXES NEEDED:
 */

// 1. DATABASE SCHEMA UPDATE
// Add experienceId to key models for proper scoping
`
model Tenant {
  whopExperienceId String? @unique  // ✅ ADDED
}

model Challenge {
  experienceId String?              // ✅ ADDED  
  @@index([experienceId])          // ✅ ADDED
}
`

// 2. AUTH LOGIC UPDATE
// Use experienceId for user context and data scoping
`
// Current (Wrong):
const user = await getCurrentUser(); // Based on company
const challenges = await prisma.challenge.findMany({
  where: { tenantId: user.tenantId }  // Company-wide
});

// Fixed (Correct):
const { experienceId } = await getExperienceContext();
const challenges = await prisma.challenge.findMany({
  where: { experienceId: experienceId }  // Experience-specific
});
`

// 3. CLIENT-SIDE SDK INTEGRATION
// Add proper iFrame SDK for embedded apps
`
// Missing components:
import { WhopIframeSdkProvider } from '@whop/react';
import { WhopWebsocketProvider } from '@whop/react';

// Needed in root layout or app component
<WhopIframeSdkProvider>
  <WhopWebsocketProvider>
    {children}
  </WhopWebsocketProvider>
</WhopIframeSdkProvider>
`

// 4. ACCESS CONTROL UPDATE
// Use proper Whop access checks per experience
`
// Current (Wrong):
const accessResult = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToCompany({
  userId, companyId
});

// Fixed (Correct):
const accessResult = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
  userId, experienceId
});
`

/**
 * MIGRATION STRATEGY:
 * 
 * Phase 1: Schema Migration
 * - Add experienceId fields
 * - Update indexes
 * - Migrate existing data
 * 
 * Phase 2: Auth System Update  
 * - Fix getExperienceContext() to be primary
 * - Update all API routes to use experienceId
 * - Add proper access checks
 * 
 * Phase 3: Client SDK Integration
 * - Add WhopIframeSdkProvider
 * - Implement proper iFrame communication
 * - Add WebSocket support
 * 
 * Phase 4: Testing & Validation
 * - Test with multiple experiences per company
 * - Verify data isolation
 * - Check admin access across experiences
 */

/**
 * IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:
 */

const FIXES_NEEDED = [
  "1. Update schema: Add experienceId fields",
  "2. Fix auth logic: Use experienceId as primary isolation",
  "3. Update API routes: Filter by experienceId, not tenantId", 
  "4. Add client SDK: WhopIframeSdkProvider setup",
  "5. Test isolation: Multiple experiences per company",
  "6. Validate access: Experience-based admin checks"
];

/**
 * KEY REALIZATION:
 * 
 * Our current system works for "one app per company" but breaks
 * when a company installs the app in multiple communities.
 * 
 * Whop's architecture is designed for Experience-level isolation,
 * not Company-level isolation.
